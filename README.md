# Java-Guessing-Game
# Overview

This is a Java number guessing game. The game generates a "secret number" between 0 and 99 then propts the user to guess the number. Each guess is saved as an upper or lower limit to help the
user to narrow down their search.

There is also a hello world program to help anyone get started.
