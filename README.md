# Java-Guessing-Game
# Overview

This is a Java number guessing game. The game generates a "secret number" between 0 and 99 then propts the user to guess the number. Each guess is saved as an upper or lower limit to help the
user to narrow down their search.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
